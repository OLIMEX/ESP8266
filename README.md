## Build toolchain

https://github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk is easy to use, it basically does all on its own.

- Clone the repository to ```/opt/Espressif``` (or somewhere else, this path seems to be preferred by some people)
- Install dependencies: ```sudo apt-get install make unrar-free autoconf automake libtool gcc g++ gperf flex bison texinfo gawk ncurses-dev libexpat-dev python sed help2man```
- ```make```, not as root - wait a few minutes, done.
- Add ```export PATH="${PATH}:/opt/Espressif/xtensa-lx106-elf/bin"``` to your .bashrc, .profile, .zshrc, whatever. Or just run it every time you want to use the toolchain.

In some versions of the SDK there seems to be a problem with some type definitions. If you have problems compiling with errors that some types are not defined try opening ```xtensa-lx106-elf/xtensa-lx106-elf/sysroot/usr/include/c_types.h``` and replace ```#if 0``` near the top with ```#if 1```.

## Get esptool

Some projects use ```esptool```, which is something completely different as ```esptool.py``` and which is not installed by ```esp-open-sdk```. You can get ```esptool``` here:

or here:
