6.Add 1024KB+1024KB flash map which need boot_v1.4+ and flash download tool_v1.2+, more details in document "2A-ESP8266_IOT_SDK_User_Manual"
7.Optimized PWM driver
8.Revised structure mdns_info to support 10 groups of text data.
9.user_rf_pre_init has to be added in user_main.c, user can call system_phy_set_rfoption to set configuration of RF in it.Could refer to user_main.c in IOT_Demo (\esp_iot_sdk\examples)
10.Update smartconfig
(1) Need not call wifi_station_set_auto_connect to disable auto-connect before smartconfig any more
(2) Delete smartconfig_get_status
(3) Updates the example of smartconfig_start in "2C_ESP8266__Programming Guide" 
11.Remove some useless API from os_api.h, such as
CODE: SELECT ALL
diff -r esp_iot_sdk_v1.0.1/include/osapi.h esp_iot_sdk_v1.1.0/include/osapi.h
39,41d31
< #define os_timer_done ets_timer_done
< #define os_timer_handler_isr ets_timer_handler_isr
< #define os_timer_init ets_timer_init
45d34
< #define os_update_cpu_frequency ets_update_cpu_frequency

12.Remove interrupt related API from os_api.h, please use API in ets_sys.h instead, such as
CODE: SELECT ALL
diff -r esp_iot_sdk_v1.0.1/include/osapi.h esp_iot_sdk_v1.1.0/include/osapi.h
#define os_intr_lock ets_intr_lock
#define os_intr_unlock ets_intr_unlock
#define os_isr_attach ets_isr_attach
#define os_isr_mask ets_isr_mask
#define os_isr_unmask ets_isr_unmask

CODE: SELECT ALL
#define PERIPHS_IO_MUX_PULLDWN          BIT6
#define PERIPHS_IO_MUX_SLEEP_PULLDWN    BIT2
#define PIN_PULLDWN_DIS(PIN_NAME)             CLEAR_PERI_REG_MASK(PIN_NAME, PERIPHS_IO_MUX_PULLDWN)
#define PIN_PULLDWN_EN(PIN_NAME)              SET_PERI_REG_MASK(PIN_NAME, PERIPHS_IO_MUX_PULLDWN)

Note:
There are no pull-down functions on GPIO pad now, so we should never use these registers.
Add external resistance to pulldown the pin.
